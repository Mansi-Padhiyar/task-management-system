Purpose of AI Assistance

AI was used as a development assistant for:

Generating boilerplate Flask and React code

Suggesting REST structure improvements

Improving validation logic

Reviewing architectural clarity

Constraints Provided to AI

The following constraints were enforced:

Use Flask for backend

Use a relational database

Follow RESTful design principles

Keep architecture simple and modular

Implement backend validation

Use proper HTTP status codes

Avoid unnecessary dependencies

Coding Standards Applied

Clear separation of frontend and backend

Single responsibility per function

Explicit validation at API boundary

SQL-based relational persistence

Minimal and readable code structure

Human Review Process

All AI-generated code was:

Manually reviewed

Tested locally

Refined for clarity and correctness

Adjusted to meet assignment requirements

AI acted as an assistant, not an autonomous decision-maker.
